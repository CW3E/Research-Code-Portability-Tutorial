    "One way someone can make their code more replicable and user-friendly through the use of an universal configuration file. Environmental variables/global parameters are defined in a configuration file rather than directly in the scripts. This removes the need for a user to manually go, find, and edit a hard-coded environmental variable or parameter within the every script in a workflow. Hence, by creating a configuration file, you are helping with your program's efficiency and user productivity. \n",
