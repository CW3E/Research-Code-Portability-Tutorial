# Research-Code-Portability-Tutorial
---

## Description 
This repository will review the steps to build a Singularity container from a definition file and implement it into scripts. Furthermore, this repository also covers developing and implementing a configuration file into scripts. Singularity containers and configuration files aim to make coding workflows more efficient and portable. Integrating these features into scripts will be a significant time-saver for research and data analysis work. 

These tutorials are Jupyter Notebooks; some features, such as internal links, may not render in GitHub correctly. Please copy and paste the notebook URL into [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/) for full compatibility.
